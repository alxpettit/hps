##### An idea for implementing via YAML syntax
##### I will probably not be using this, as markdown is a slightly more human-friendly format with built in support for things like hotlinks

# This data storage format is highly flexible and somewhat fluid
# It results in a lot of user choice on how to hierarchically store their data, if they are editing their calendar by hand.
# The program iterates over all subnodes recursively, reading time data from each. If parent node time data conflicts with child node time data, child node will override parent node.
# Otherwise, node information is aggregated together.
# For instance, if you have a series of tasks every monday, you can put them under a 'Monday' heading,
# and merely specify times of day in each subnode.

# Assumes monday of this week.
Monday:
    - 12:33 Hi I'm a task!
        - Hi, I'm a subtask...

# A task for today
Today:
    - This is a task for TODAY!

- 5:33 Another task for today...
